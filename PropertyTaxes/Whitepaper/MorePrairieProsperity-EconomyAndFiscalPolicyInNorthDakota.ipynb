    "## Economic Health\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to economic health, productivity is fundamental. There are a variety of macroeconomic measures that indicate economic health. We focus on GDP per capita, personal income per capita, and the rate of unemployment. On all fronts, North Dakota performs better than most of the nation as well as the Upper Midwest. As with productivity, North Dakota leads the region and nation in economic productivity. Per capita peronsal incomes are the highest in the region (\\\\$70,360). Higher per capita personal income is an indication of prosperity in general. The impact of personal income on the standard of living, however, is informed by the distribution of this income. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general we can think of income as being divided between proprietors - business owners who are commonly referred to as entrepreneurs - and non-proprietors who typically receive their income in the form of wages and salaries. Proprietors receive a relatively large portion of this income. In North Dakota, proprietors recieive approximately 16\\% of personal income earned in the state and region. The only other state in the region where entrepreneurs receive a comparable portion of personal income is South Dakota, whose proprietors earned 17.9\\% of personal income earned in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietor personal income can be split between farm proprietors and non-farm proprietors. In 2022, farm proprietors in North Dakota earned a share of personal income (8.4\\%) greater than for farm proprietors in any other state in both the region and nation. This is a persistent feature of the North Dakota economy. North Dakota is often trading $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ place with its southern neighbor, South Dakota, where in 2022 farmers earned 6.5\\% of personal income. At 11.4\\%, non-farm proprietor income as a share of personal income is greater in South Dakota than in any other state in the region. North Dakota ranks 4th in this category, exactly in the middle regionally, with a value of 7.6\\%.\n",

    "Most individuals do not run a business, so the largest share of personal income typically goes toward labor. Again, comparing North Dakota to other states in the region, we can see that overall workplace compensation (listed as earnings by workplace in the BEA dataset) in North Dakota has, for more than a decade been significantly higher than for any state. North Dakota suffers from relative labor scarcity, which tends to drive up wages. Part of the high wages can also be attributed to the extent of oil extraction occurring in North Dakota, a sector where low-skill workers earn relatively higher wages. Over 4% of personal income earned in North Dakota 2022 came from Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. The next highest regional competitor in this category is Kansas, with about 0.7\\% of personal income earned from this productive sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in the contribution of construction to personal income in North Dakota has tended to closely follow changes in personal income derived from mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction. As mining productivity increased during the last decade, so did demand for housing by labor. Western North Dakota did not have a plentious stock of housing meet these demands. Construction of homes is a direct response. Thus, the relationship between these two categories appears to be strong and linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant amount of personal income in North Dakota is derived from government expenses and government enterprises, and this has traditionally been the case. In 2022, 11.6% of personal income was received from government and government enterprises. Perhaps this should not be surprising as North Dakota's revenues on a per capita basis exceed all other states in the region. Broken down among other sectors as a percent of state income, top components include:\n",

    "- Management of Companies and Enterprises\n",
    "- Finance and Insurance\n",

    "This owes partly due to North Dakota's position as, perhaps, the most rural state in the Union. While development of these sectors need not be a target of policy, development can be facilitated by continuation of policies that attract business to North Dakota, thereby supporting continued urbanization in North Dakota's major centers. Ideally, growing investment can facilitate business development that attract professionals with cutting edge knowledge in technically advanced industries to North Dakota's urban areas. \n"

    "Fiscal policy refers to the financial program and financial condition of a government. Each year, state and local governments generate revenues and expenditures. State and local governments are typically expected to use revenues support and maintain travel infrastructure, primary and secondary education, public safety operations,natural resource management and public parks, and so forth. A government must also pay interest on its debts and is incumbent to interest owed for bonds that it has accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared Responsibilities and Intergovernmental Transfers\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the health of the state as a whole, we must consider fiscal policy at both the state and local levels. A significant portion of the budget of the state of North Dakota is comprised of transfers from the Federal Government. Federal Transfer compraised over 40\\% of North Dakota's 2022. Likewise, over 25\\% of North Dakota's expenditures in 2022 were dedicated to transfers from the state to local governments.

    "## Major Revenues Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### State\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learn above, a major portion of North Dakota's revenue is derived from federal transers. The second largest source of revenue for the state is revenue generated from oil extraction. This revenue is included in the category, \"Other Taxes\". This has been a consistently large portion of state revenues since 2008 when it composed 18.1\\% of the state budget. Since then, it has comprised as much as 38.5\\% of revenue. As of 2022, 18.8\\% of the state budget is derived from this source. Oil production in 2023 and 2024 has modestly improved as the price of crude oil has mostly remained in the range of \\\\$70-\\\\$90 per barrel during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deficit, Debts, and Obligations\n",
    "\n",
    "North Dakota is one of only a few states in the nation that typically run a budget surplus, meaning that revenues exceed expenditures. It is also one of the few states that have accumulated savings in excess of 2 year of expenditures. In the past several years, we have seen oil productivity and state revenues tied to this productivity stabilize in North Dakota. This stability indicates that the apparent state of fiscal policy in North Dakota is not transitory. The current status quo is, therefore, an appropriate interpretive anchor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does North Dakota rank first in the region by this measure receiving \\\\$5,768 per capita, as compared to second place Minnesota who receive federal funds amounting to \\\\$3,473 per capita. As a percent of GDP, this amounts to 6.3\\%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall government revenues from all levels for North Dakota sums to 19.3% of GDP.The next highest competitor is Minnesota at 18.0%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Taxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of property taxes deserves special consideration in our analysis as property taxes play a critical role in supporting local expenditures and, therefore, autonomy in local decision-making. There are two primary sources of revenue for local governments in North Dakota. One source is property taxes. The other is intergovernmental transfers: funds provided to local governments by the state and federal governments. In 2021, 48.1\\% of local revenue was derived from state transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, property taxes are viewed as supporting education expenses as these expenses comprise about a third of local budgets. In recent years, property taxes are typically between 25\\% of the annual local budget.\n",

    "The prosperity of a region is dependent upon the quality of and incentives generated by its institutions. Institutions are coordination devices that improve the predictability of behavior among those who adopt the institutions (Searle 2005). Instituions can take a variety of forms that are as simple as a well regulated system of roads and traffic lights to vastly more complex legal institutions that guarantee one's right to person and property. Federal, state, and local governments are all institutions, as is the obligation of paying one's income tax each year. In order for institutions to function, it is critical that actors have incentive to follow the rules of behavior indicated by the institution (Grief 2008; Grief and Kingston 2011). This is especially true with regard to constraints placed on state actors. If rules do not constrain the scope of action for executives, bureacrats, and the like, than the predictability of legal protections and the legal consequences of a particular course of action become less effective (Hayek 1944; 1960). Corruption in the form of bribery, nepotism, may become an attractive substitute for the rule of law. \n",

Productive and efficient businesses improve social welfare by reducing the cost of providing goods and services, by improving the quality of those goods and services at a given cost, and by generating new kinds of goods and services.

According to the latest measures from the FRASER Institute's Economic Freedom Index of North America, North Dakota is the state with the 8th highest measure of economic freedom, and it has the highest economic freedom of any state in the Upper Midwest. As with any aggregate, any given policy or regulation governing economic activity in North Dakota may be better or worse than this average. In general, regulation in North Dakota is relatively good.
