    "With regard to economic health, productivity is fundamental. There are a variety of macroeconomic measures that indicate economic health. We focus on GDP per capita, personal income per capita, and the rate of unemployment. On all fronts, North Dakota performs better than most of the nation as well as the Upper Midwest. As with productivity, North Dakota leads the region and nation in economic productivity. Per capita peronsal incomes are the highest in the region (\\$70,360). Higher per capita personal income is an indication of prosperity in general. The impact of personal income on the standard of living, however, is informed by the distribution of this income. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general we can think of income as being divided between proprietors - business owners who are commonly referred to as entrepreneurs - and non-proprietors who typically receive their income in the form of wages and salaries. Proprietors receive a relatively large portion of this income. In North Dakota, proprietors recieive approximately 16\\% of personal income earned in the state and region. The only other state in the region where entrepreneurs receive a comparable portion of personal income is South Dakota, whose proprietors earned 17.9\\% of personal income earned in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietor personal income can be split between farm proprietors and non-farm proprietors. In 2022, farm proprietors in North Dakota earned a share of personal income (8.4\\%) greater than for farm proprietors in any other state in both the region and nation. This is a persistent feature of the North Dakota economy. North Dakota is often trading $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ place with its southern neighbor, South Dakota, where in 2022 farmers earned 6.5\\% of personal income. At 11.4\\%, non-farm proprietor income as a share of personal income is greater in South Dakota than in any other state in the region. North Dakota ranks 4th in this category, exactly in the middle regionally, with a value of 7.6\\%.\n",

    "*Analysis is supported by data from this and similar application throughout the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most individuals do not run a business, so the largest share of personal income typically goes toward labor. Again, comparing North Dakota to other states in the region, we can see that overall workplace compensation (listed as earnings by workplace in the BEA dataset) in North Dakota has, for more than a decade been significantly higher than for any state. North Dakota suffers from relative labor scarcity, which tends to drive up wages. Part of the high wages can also be attributed to the extent of oil extraction occurring in North Dakota, a sector where low-skill workers earn relatively higher wages. Over 4% of personal income earned in North Dakota 2022 came from Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. The next highest regional competitor in this category is Kansas, with about 0.7\\% of personal income earned from this productive sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant amount of personal income in North Dakota is derived from government expenses and government enterprises, and this has traditionally been the case. In 2022, 11.6% of personal income was received from government and government enterprises. Perhaps this should not be surprising as North Dakota's revenues on a per capita basis exceed all other states in the region. Broken down among other sectors as a percent of state income, top components include:\n",

    "If we compare North Dakota with other states, we notice that North Dakota lags behind most other states in the share of income earned in areas requiring intensive human capital: \n",

    "- Professional, Scientific, and Techinical Services\n",
    "- Management of Companies and Enterprises\n",
    "- Finance and Insurance\n",
    "- Educational Services\n",
    "\n",
    "This owes partly due to North Dakota's position as, perhaps, the most rural state in the Union. While development of these sectors need not be a target of policy, development can be facilitated by continuation of policies that attract business to North Dakota, thereby supporting continued urbanization in North Dakota's major centers. Ideally, growing investment can facilitate business development that attract professionals with cutting edge knowledge in technically advanced industries to North Dakota's urban areas. \n",
