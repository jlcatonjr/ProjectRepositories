    "# More Prairie Prosperity: Economy and Fiscal Policy in North Dakota\n",

    "\n",
    "With regard to economic health, productivity is fundamental. There are a variety of macroeconomic measures that indicate economic health. These often include the rate of unemployment, GDP per capita, personal income per capita, and the rate of unemployment. Across states in the Union, variation in these measures is a function of location, allocation of human capital, and policy that is friendly to business. If policy makers would like to strengthen economic development, adoption of policies that reduce the cost of doing business within a state is the best path to accomplishing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The federal system within the United States allows each state to act as a laboratory of policy experimentation. While the federal government significantly influences the policy environment for all states, states can set policy with a significant amount of leeway. Legislative, executive, and judicial branches operating at the state level can generate significant variation in fiscal policy and regulation of business. In general, fiscal policies that limit expenditures will tend to put less stress on state finances than those that engage in expansive programs of expenditure. Other details, like the extent of net indebtedeness, the maintainence of solvency of state retirement funds, and the efficiency of expenditures provide a finer resolution of fiscal health. In the modern federalist system, we must also consider the extent of financial flows between  local, state, and national levels of government to understand the extent of financial interdependedness and financial autonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of incomes and extent of fiscal health are factors that influence the attractiveness of a state for labor and for business. In popular conversation, North Dakota is viewed as a state that is relatively open to business. Using data from the Fraser Economic Freedom Index of North America, we can evaluate the manner in which North Dakota and neighboring states are more or less accomodative of business operations. In general, the data we consider here aligns with the perception that North Dakota is a state where personal incomes are high, the cost of doing business is low, and fiscal policy is constrained. However, some important details, such as the states level of expenditures as a percent of GDP, push against this narrative. \n",

    "### How is Income Distributed?\n",
    "We can think of income as being divided between proprietors - business owners who are commonly referred to as entrepreneurs - and non-proprietors who typically receive their income in the form of wages and salaries. In North Dakota, proprietors recieive approximately 16\\% of personal income earned in the state and region. The only other state in the region where entrepreneurs receive a comparable portion of personal income is South Dakota, whose proprietors earned 17.9\\% of personal income earned in the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proprietor personal income can be split between farm proprietors and non-farm proprietors. In 2022, farm proprietors in North Dakota earned a share of personal income (8.4\\%) greater than for farm proprietors in any other state in both the region and nation. North Dakota also ranks first in the region with regard to farm earnings per capita. This is a persistent feature of the North Dakota economy. For this category, North Dakota is often trading $1^{st}$ and 2^{nd} place with its souther neighbor, South Dakota, where in 2022 farmers earned 6.5% of personal income. At 11.4%, _non-farm proprietor income_ as a share of personal income is greater in South Dakota than in any other state in the region. North Dakota ranks 4th in this category, exactly in the middle regionally, with a value of 7.6%. When _nonfarm earnings_ measured on a per capita basis, North Dakota ranks second in the region.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the discrepancy between _farm proprietor income_ and _farm earnings_ is quite small. Earnings earned by labor are a relatively small share of _farm earnings_. Although _nonfarm proprietor income_ is often a similar share of total income as _farm proprietor income_, total _nonfarm earnings_ is typically between 60 and 80% of all personal income in the state. The discrepancy between _nonfarm earnings received by proprietors_ and _nonfarm earnings_ received in the form of _wages, salary, and supplements_ is less the 1 percent for states in the region. In other words, a significant share of _nonfarm earnings_ are received by labor and the vast majority of labor works in nonfarm industries. \n",

    "Most individuals do not run a business, so the largest share of personal income typically goes toward labor. Comparing North Dakota to other states in the region, we can see that overall workplace compensation (listed as _wages, salaries and supplements_) in North Dakota has, for more than a decade been significantly higher than for any state. North Dakota suffers from relative labor scarcity, which tends to drive up wages. Part of the high wages can also be attributed to the extent of oil extraction occurring in North Dakota, a sector where low-skill workers earn relatively higher wages. Over 4% of personal income earned in North Dakota 2022 came from mining, _quarrying, and oil and gas extraction_. The next highest regional competitor in this category is Kansas, with about 0.7\\% of personal income earned from this productive sector. Changes in the contribution of construction to personal income in North Dakota has tended to closely follow changes in personal income derived from _mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction_. As mining productivity increased during the last decade, so did demand for housing by labor. Western North Dakota did not have a plentious stock of housing meet these demands. Construction of homes is a direct response. Thus, the relationship between these _mining_ and _construction_ appears to be strong and linear.\n",

    "A significant amount of personal income in North Dakota is derived from _government expenses and government enterprises_, and this has traditionally been the case. In 2022, 11.6% of personal income was received from _government and government enterprises_. Although North Dakota spends relatively more in this category as a proportion of personal income, the general trend in the state and across the region is that expenses for government and government enterprises have been shrinking as real per capita incomes and population has been increasing. Even on a per capita basis, government expenditures across the region decreased significantly in 2021 and again in 2022. In fact, on a per capita basis since at least 2015, real income derived from activity within _government and government enterprise_ has not been lower than it is now since 2015. For North Dakota, in particular, real per capita expenditures have not been lower than they are now since 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare North Dakota with other states, we notice that North Dakota lags behind most others in the share of income earned in areas requiring intensive human capital: \n",

    "- Professional, Scientific, and Techinical Services\n",
    "- Management of Companies and Enterprises\n",
    "- Finance and Insurance\n",
    "- Educational Services\n",
    "\n",
    "This owes partly due to North Dakota's position as, perhaps, the most rural state in the Union. While development of these sectors need not be a target of policy, development can be facilitated by continuation of policies that attract business to North Dakota, thereby supporting continued urbanization in North Dakota's major centers. Ideally, growing investment can facilitate business development that will continue to attract professionals with cutting edge knowledge in technically advanced industries to North Dakota's urban areas.

    "# Fiscal Health\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiscal policy refers to the financial program and financial condition of a government. Each year, state and local governments generate revenues and expenditures. State and local governments are typically expected to use revenues support and maintain travel infrastructure, primary and secondary education, public safety operations,natural resource management and public parks, and so forth. A government must also pay interest on its debts and is incumbent to interest owed for bonds that it has accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared Responsibilities and Intergovernmental Transfers\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the health of the state as a whole, we must consider fiscal policy at both the state and local levels. A significant portion of the budget of the state of North Dakota is comprised of transfers from the Federal Government. Federal Transfer compraised over 40\\% of North Dakota's 2022. Likewise, over 25\\% of North Dakota's expenditures in 2022 were dedicated to transfers from the state to local governments. As a percentage of local revenues, this amounted to 48.1\\% of all local revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze each level of expenditure keeping in mind the relationship of expenditures and transfers at each level. State and local government share funding responsibilities. For example, 15.1\\% of state expenditures are dedicated to education expenses, whereas 38.8\\% of local expenditures are dedicated to education expenses. Maintainence of highways also entails a large portion of expenditures at both levels, comprising 7.6\\% of the state budget and 12.5\\% of all local budgets. At the local level, a limited sphere of activity tends, even without explicit earmarking, to focus local expenditures on education and highways, which comprise a majority of the average local expenditures across the state. Expenditures under the headings of intergovernmental transfers, public welfare, public welfare, education, and insurance trusts comprise the largest share of the expenditure budget. This pattern of expenditure allocation at the state and local level follows a similar patterns across the region. \n",

    "### [State Finances](#StateData)\n",
    "### Revenues\n",
    "\n",
    "The annual budget of the state of North Dakota can be divided into two broad categories: _revenues derived from own sources_ and _intergovernmental revenues_ that are transfers from either the federal government or local governments within the state. In 2021, 40.2\\% of the state's revenues were derived from external sources, namely, the federal government. Within the region, North Dakota ranked second in the category of intergovernmental transfers, exceeded only by Missouri. For much of the decade preceding 2020, North Dakota as a recipient of external funds, North Dakota ranked no higher than the third lowest and for 5 of those years received the lowest amount of transfers amongst states in the region. With regard to the states own sources of funding, the largest sources of revenue include _other taxes_ (18.8\\%), _sales and gross receipts_ (15.3\\%), _current charges_ (8.9\\%), _interest earnings_ (6.6\\%), and individual income taxes (4.8\\%). Among other sources, current charges include payments to state supported entities such as \"tution paid to a university, payments to a a public hospital, and tolls on highways ([The Tax Policy Briefing Book](https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-sources-revenue-state-and-local-governments)).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest portion _revenue from own sources_ in 2021, _other taxes_, includes taxes derived from the extraction and sale of oil in North Dakota. In 2005, this source of revenue comprised only 9.7\\% of state revenues, whereas sales and gross receipts represented 21.2\\%. As we learn from [Table 3](#Table3), a major portion of North Dakota's revenue is derived from federal transfers. The second largest source of revenue for the state is revenue generated from oil extraction. This revenue is included in the category, \"Other Taxes\". This has been a consistently large portion of state revenues since 2008 when it composed 18.1\\% of the state budget. Since then, it has comprised as much as 38.5\\% of revenue. As of 2021, 18.8\\% of the state budget is derived from this source. Oil production in 2023 and 2024 has modestly improved as the price of crude oil has mostly remained in the range of \\\\$70-\\\\$90 per barrel during that time. It seems that North Dakota has reached a stable baseline for crude production and, therefore, real revenues derived from crude oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past several years, we have seen [oil production](#StateData) and state revenues tied to this productivity stabilize in North Dakota. This stability indicates that the apparent state of fiscal policy in North Dakota is not transitory. The current status quo is, therefore, an appropriate interpretive anchor. State revenue derived from oil production essentially explains the strong fiscal position of North Dakota compared to its neighbors. On a per capita basis, revenues from _other taxes_ is nearly as large as the entire the gap in revenues when comparing the amount of revenue collected by North Dakota with Minnesota, which has the second highest level of revenue per capita in the region. North Dakota collects \\\\$13,488 in general revenue per capita, \\\\$2,536 of which from the per capita measure of _other taxes_. Minnesota collects Â\\$10,448 per capita in general revenue, from which \\\\$243 is derived from _other taxes_. To be fair, North Dakota's _general revenue from own sources_ amounts to \\\\$8,068 per capita, whereas Minnesota draws \\\\$7,354 per capita from its _own sources_. The remainder of this discrepancy between _general revenue_ and _revenue from own sources_ is attributed to intergovernmental transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following _other taxes_, the next largest sources of income for North Dakota are dervied from _sales and gross receipts_ and _current charges_. Sales tax and taxes on gross receipts are a ubiquitous source of revenue across all states. For the region, North Dakota is about average, receiving 2.25\\% of its revenues from this source. As a portion of general revenue, South Dakota leads this category with a value of 2.85\\% and Missouri sets the lower bound with 1.63\\% of revenue derived from _sales and gross receipts_. In 2021, _current charges_ amounted to nearly \\\\$1,200 per capita. For current charges received on a per capita basis, North Dakota ranks 3rd in the region, surpassed by Iowa (\\\\$1,502) and Kansas (\\\\$1885). Unlike other sources of revenue, revenue derived from current charges indicate demand for a service provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major portion of North Dakota's annual revenue is derived from federal transfers. Not only does North Dakota rank first in the region by this measure receiving \\\\$5,421 per capita in 2021. As a percent of GDP, this amounted to 5.9\\%. That may not seem like much, but as a percentage of _general revenue_, this is 39.7\\%. Compare this to second place Minnesota who receive federal funds amounting to \\\\$3,164 per capita. These high amounts of federal funding, however, is in part due to response to Covid 19. Between 2005 and 2019, federal transfers comprised no more the 31.2\\% of the state budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a source of state revenue, revenue generated from income taxes in North Dakota are amongst the lowest in the region. Only 6.47\\% of North Dakota's revenue is generated from individual and corporate income taxes. Only South Dakota ranks lower according to this measure, with 1.04\\% of its revenue generated from income taxes. Iowa (19.36\\%), Kansas (21.83\\%), Missouri (22.44\\%), Nebraska (25.49\\%), and Minnesota (33.12\\%) all generate a larger portion of their revenue from individual and corporate income taxes.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### [Tax Brackets](#StateData)\n",
    "\n",
    "The extent of revenue generated from income taxes is a function of the rate at which incomes of individuals and corporations are taxed. Although we do not yet have granular revenue data available at the state level for 2024, we see that North Dakota is still amongst the states with the lowest income tax rates. North Dakota's maximum individual income tax rate is 2.5\\%, significantly lower than all other states, except those with an individual income tax rate of 0.0\\%. States with the highest individual income tax rate include New York (10.9\\%), Hawaii (11.0\\%), and California (13.3\\%). \n",
    "\n",
    "With a rate of 4.23\\%, North Dakota is again among the states with the lowest maximum corporate income tax rates. Aside from states with a corporate income tax rate of 0.0\\% (Nevada, Ohio, south Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming), Only Oklahoma (4.0\\%), Missouri (4.0\\%), and North Carolina (2.5\\%) have maximum corporate income tax rates lower than North Dakota. Although the individual income tax rate for Minnesota is 0.0\\%, at a rate of 9.8\\%, the corporate income tax rate in Minnesota is the highest in the nation. Minnesota is followed by Alaska (9.4\\%), Maine (8.93\\%), and California (8.84\\%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expenditures\n",
    "\n",
    "Using broad categories, state expenditures are comprised of _intergovernmental expenditure_, _current operations_, _capital outlay_, _assistance and subsidies_, _interest on debt_, and _insurance benefits and repayments_. As mentioned above, intergovernmental transfers typically refer to transfers from the state to local governments. On a per capita basis, in 2021 North Dakota spent more on intergovernmental transfers than any other state in the region (\\\\$3,442), although Minnesota (\\\\$3,440) is not far behind by this measure. As a percentage of GDP, Minnesota (4.19\\%) leads second place North Dakota (3.77\\%). North Dakota also leads all other states in the region with regard to expenditures on current operations as a percentage of GDP, though as a percentage of current expenditures North Dakota (52.67\\%) ranks third to last in the region. Although expenditures are quite high, one must keep in mind that the cost of operations is partly offset by current charges. This would indicate that although a significant value of services are provided by the state of North Dakota, these services do not represent pure transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Capital outlays_ consist mostly of costs incurred due to construction of facilities and otherwise include buildings and equipment that are refurbished. The result are assets owned by the state. It is useful, then, to see capital expenditures as a form of savings to the extent that property could be sold by the state. This is particularly the case for the construction and refurbishment of buildings whose values tend to be maintained and has often increased in recent decades as the price of land and costs of construction have increased. During years where _general revenues_ were relatively elevated due to increases in revenue extraction from oil production, so too were capital expenditures elevated. In 2021, the real value of capital expenditure measured in 2023 dollars was \\\\$852 million, well below a high of \\\\$1.3 billion set in 2015. Measured in per capita terms, North Dakota has led the region in capital expenditures in every year except for 2018 and 2020, both of which were led by South Dakota. Although from the perspective of the state budget, this can be thought of as a form of savings, much like home ownership is a form of a saving, the high level of capital investment by the state also influences resource allocation. Policy makers may want to consider dedicating these funds to a different part of the budget to the extent that these projects due not appear to efficiently support the function of services provided by the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, North Dakota's per capita expenditures on _assitance and subsidies_ have been the median level for the region since 2017. In general, state level expenditures in this area are limited, amounting only to \\\\$211 in real per capita terms in 2021. Compare this to the greatest level of expenditure in the region by Minnesota at \\\\$289 per capita. At the national level, the states with the highest level of expenditures in this category were Maryland (\\\\$588), Arizona(\\\\$575), Delaware (\\\\$486), and Utah (\\\\$368). \n",

    "The North Dakota State Investment Board of Trustees oversees to retirement systems in the state of North Dakota. The Teachers' Fund for Retirement (TFFR) and the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System (NDPERS). Although these funds have tended to perform well in the last two decades, good performance of a fund does not offset discrepancies between the value of assets and liabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state fund must be managed so that the expected value of future payouts are offset by the expected value of assets that would need to be sold to in order to generate the funds required to meet expected obligations. Using the actuarial valuations under GASB (Governmental Accounting Standards Board) standards, we can compare the actuarial value of assets and liabilities to estimate the percent of liabilities that are expected to be covered by a retirement fund. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the state's two funds, NDPERS is significantly larger than TFFR. Using GASB standard, in 2023 the actuarial value of NDPERS liabilties is \\\\$4.58 billion and the actuarial value of assets is \\\\$3.26 billion, leaving \\\\$1.32 billion of liabilities funded. This amounts to 71.2\\% of liabilties from NDPERS being funded. Using the same standards, in 2022 the smaller TFFR had \\\\$116.1 million in assets and \\\\$140.6 million in liabilities, leaving an unfunded amount of \\\\$24.5 million, meaing that 82.5\\% of TFFR liabilities are funded. \n",

The Minnesota General Employeees Retirement Plan is 83.6\\%, with various plans for teachers, public safety, and state employees being 76.9\\%, 97.0\\%, and 95.1\\% funded, respectively. The Nebraska Public Employees Retirement System for school employees is only funded at 53.4\\% as of 2022.

    "As indicated in [Table 3](#Table3), local expenditures in North Dakota focus primarily and mainting roads and supporting education. Aside from these, there is a relatively clear distinction in North Dakota between services managed at the state level and those managed at the local level. Among utilities, police, housing, parks and recreation, air transportation (airports), solid waste, fire, and sewarage, none make up greater than 0.5\\% of all state expenditures.Each of these categories typically make up more than 1\\% of local budgets. These services, then, are dependent on local revenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on education expenditure, we see that as a proportion of all state and local expenditure, education comprises 28.4\\% of this total. Education expenditures in 2022 amounted to \\\\$3.4 billion, with state expenditures comprising \\\\$1.4 billion of this amount. Local expenditures comprise the remaining \\\\$2 billion. State and local expenditures share close to even split of maintaining roads and highways and north Dakota, spending a total of \\\\$1.4 billion. with the state paying about \\\\$45 million more than local governments on this maintainence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, nearly half of all local expenditures were supported by state transfers. A shrinking local budget may impact provision of services not significantly supported by state funds unless compensated for by transfers from the of North Dakota. To the extent that these local services become dependent upon state funds in lieu of locally generated revenue, local autonomy concerning the provision of these goods will be weakened in favor of control at the state level.\n",

    "### [Property Taxes](#LocalFinances)\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of property taxes deserves special consideration in our analysis as property taxes play a critical role in supporting local expenditures and, therefore, autonomy in local decision-making. There are two primary sources of revenue for local governments in North Dakota. One source is property taxes. The other is intergovernmental transfers: funds provided to local governments by the state and federal governments. In 2021, 48.1\\% of local revenue was derived from state transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, property taxes are viewed as supporting education expenses as these expenses comprise about a third of local budgets. In recent years, property taxes are typically between 25\\% of the annual local budget. In 2022, this amounted to 23.3\\% of local revenues. As the sum of state transfers and local property tax collections amount to over 72\\% of state revenues, less than 28\\% of local revenue remains when these two categories are removed.\n",

    "The prosperity of a region is dependent upon the quality of and incentives generated by its institutions. Institutions are coordination devices that improve the predictability of behavior among those who adopt the institutions (Searle 2005). Instituions can take a variety of forms that are as simple as a well regulated system of roads and traffic lights to vastly more complex legal institutions that guarantee one's right to person and property. Federal, state, and local governments are all institutions, as is the obligation of paying one's income tax each year. In order for institutions to function, it is critical that actors have incentive to follow the rules of behavior indicated by the institution (Grief 2008; Grief and Kingston 2011). This is especially true with regard to constraints placed on state actors. If rules do not constrain the scope of action for executives, bureacrats, and the like, than the predictability of legal protections and the legal consequences of a particular course of action become less effective (Hayek 1944; 1960). Corruption in the form of bribery, nepotism, may become an attractive substitute for the rule of law. \n",

As with any aggregate, any given policy or regulation governing economic activity in North Dakota may be better or worse than this average. In general, regulation in North Dakota is relatively good.
